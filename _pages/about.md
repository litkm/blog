My name is Charles Dobson. This is a personal blog. I am a former litigator; now knowledge management lawyer at Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP in Toronto, Canada.

The legal world is excited about artificial intelligence and developing better data-driven approaches to legal practice, project management, and business development. I am curious about how AI works "under the hood", especially machine learning. I am particularly interested in experimenting with how machine learning could be used in litigation, whether for analytics, research, or business development.

This blog will consist mainly of technical posts where I puzzle my way through concepts and code, but I am also aiming to include a law angle as often as possible.

If you are working on similiar projects or otherwise share this cross-disclipinary interest, please reach out! You can find me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
