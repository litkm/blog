My name is Charles Dobson. I am a former litigator, now litigation knowledge management lawyer at a law firm in Toronto, Canada.

The legal world is excited about artificial intelligence and developing better data-driven approaches to practice, project management, and business development. I am curious about how AI works "under the hood", especially machine learning. I am particularly interested in experimenting with using machine learning in litigation, whether for analytics, research, or business development.

This blog will consist mainly of technical posts where I puzzle my way through concepts and code, but I am also aiming to include a law angle as often as possible.
