In this post, I demonstrate one way this algorithm can be applied to legal data in tabular form. The dataset I use comprises matter profiles of 10,000 (fake) cases. I show how 'NearestNeighbors()' can be used to query the dataset to find cases that are similar to each other. \n",

Second, we must convert the categorial features, i.e. the non-numerical features (e.g. the various lawyer names under the Lawyer column), into numbers. These two processes are forms of normalizing a dataset.\n",

        "Normalizing the numerical features requires converting them, as necessary, so that each references the same range. If this step is neglected, then high magnitude numbers can disproportionately influence the outcome of the calculations the computer performs. When scaled, each feature will be weighted equally in the outcome. \n",

        "\n",
        "This can be done using a technique called \"min-max scaling\", which involves applying the following formula: \n",

The final result is a value (y), which is a number scaled between 0 and 1.\n",
