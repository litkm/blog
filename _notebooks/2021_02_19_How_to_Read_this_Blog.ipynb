        "As I write this, my plan for this blog is to focus mainly on technical concepts and code. Most posts will presume a familiarity with programming in general and, in particular, Python. Mind you, I won't presume deep familiarity. I can't. My own understanding is too shallow!\r\n",

        "That said, I am aiming to include a law angle as often as possible (especially litigation), and I will draft many of these posts with a general, non-technical reader in mind. So, someone who is involved in law and also interested in artificial intelligence, legal tech, etc. To find these posts efficiently, you can use the \"Tags\" function at the top right-hand of your screen and look under the tag \"general\".\r\n",
